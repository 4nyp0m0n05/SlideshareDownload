First of all you need to open page which includes slide.
After do that open your browser's console and run this command
document.querySelector('.slide_image').src
something like this 
https://image.slidesharecdn.com/xxxxxx/95/xxxxx-1-xxx.jpg?cb=xxxxxxxx
in this link find the 1 and make to iterate with slddownloader.py and write the range the page ex: 33 page write range(1,34) 
after all pictures will be downloaded in location which you run it.
When all these pictures have downloaded make changes in ppt.py for range in while loop  just do it man.
Final I hope your ppt is ready.
I am new in python for this numb program i will hope to improve it (with args).
